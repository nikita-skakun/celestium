## What is this?

**Celestium** is a 2D space station simulation and management game that explores procedural generation, simulation mechanics, and AI pathfinding.
This is a passion project, created as a way to explore advanced programming concepts and to unify them in a coherent and engaging game.

## Progress Update

Exciting new features have been added to **Celestium**! Here's a quick look at the latest developments:

- **A\* Pathfinding**: Crew members can now navigate the station using A\* pathfinding, ensuring efficient movement and intelligent routing around obstacles, bringing crew interactions to life.

- **Air Diffusion Simulation**: Oxygen management has become a key aspect of station life. Oxygen production systems can now be installed, and crew members consume oxygen as they go about their tasks. Maintaining a steady supply of breathable air is critical to keeping your crew alive and the station functional.

- **Power Storage and Connections**: Energy is now a crucial resource. Batteries can store and distribute power throughout the station, ensuring that critical life support systems stay online.

These features bring the station to life and enhance player interaction, setting the stage for deeper simulation gameplay. Stay tuned for more!
